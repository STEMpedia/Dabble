/*
   This block gives light intensity sensed by smartphone.
   NOTE:
   1)For Arduino Mega Connect Bluetooth on Serial3 pins.
   2)For Arduino Uno/Nano library uses SoftwareSerial,hence pin 2 and pin 3 are used
   as RX and TX pins respectively on SoftwareSerial.Hence with arduino Uno
   follow below connections for bluetooth.
   UNO  - BLUETOOTH
   2    - TX
   3    - RX

   3)For Uno/Nano keep bluetooth Baudrate below 38400.

   You can reduce the size of library compiled by enabling only those modules that you want
   to use. For this first define CUSTOM_SETTINGS followed by defining INCLUDE_modulename.

  Dabble.begin(9600);  //Change this baudrate as per your bluetooth baudrate. Connect bluetooth on digital pin 2(RX) and 3(TX) for Uno/Nano and on Serial3 pins for Mega.
